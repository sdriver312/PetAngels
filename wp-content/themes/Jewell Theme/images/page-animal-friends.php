						<h3>Elfe's World <span class="small">(Koh Samui, Thailand)</span></h3>
						<p>We've personally gone to visit Elfe's World and can truly say this is one amazing woman. Elfe started out on the island of Samui in 2001 with a job in a 5-star hotel. Always having loved dogs and had them in the past, she now wanted to be free and independent.</p> <p>Like hell. 12 years later this wonder-woman has pretty much single-handedly created her own refuge for the injured, homeless, hungry and lonely dogs and cats of Koh Samui. There was simply too much need on the island. She is currently sheltering 300 dogs and 30 cats. </p> <p>Elfe is also a big advocate on the stopping of the Dog Meat Trade. To date she has taken in 150 dogs rescued from this horror. Elfe counts on donations and sponsorships to keep afloat so please give what you can. Truly a deserving recipient.

						<h3>Winslow Farm Animal Sanctuary<span class="small"> (Norton, MA, USA)</span></h3>
					<p>Winslow Animal Farm is tirelessly run by an amazing woman named Debra White. Debbie worked 3 jobs simultaneously for 17 years in order to buy back land she and her father had lost (as he battled illness) and build upon it an animal sanctuary.</p><p>Established in 1996, the farm was opened to the public in 1997. It's sole purpose is to provide love and care to the many animals without a home or for those that have been abused and/or neglected by their previous owners. A sanctuary where animals can learn to trust humans again.</p> 
<p>On 5 acres of wooded farmland, Debbie takes care of previously abused and neglected pigs, horses, geese, dogs, cats, birds, alpacas, donkeys, goats, llamas, rabbits and sheep, in barns she has built with her own hands. A much deserving recipient of your tax deductible donations.</p>

						<h3>Soi Dog<span class="small"> (Phuket, Thailand)</span></h3>
					<p>Soi Dog helps the homeless, neglected and abused dogs and cats of Thailand. Their aim is to set an example for the Asian region on how to humanely reduce the number of unwanted dogs and cats through spaying and neutering, and to better the lives and living conditions of the stray dogs and feral cats of Asia. </p><p>There is an adoption program that enables people from all areas of the world to adopt one of the animals in need of a forever home. They also run a flight volunteer program which helps with rehoming animals.</p><p>Soi Dog Foundation is a not-for-profit, registered charitable organization in Thailand, the United States, Australia, the UK, France and Holland. </p>

						<h3>Samui Dog and Cat Rescue <span class="small"> (Koh Samui, Thailand)</span></h3>
					<p>Established in 1999, just as the first vet opened on the island, Samui Dog was the first organisation hell-bent on establishing a neuturing and vaccination program for the dogs and cats of Samui. Started by a German woman Bridgette Gomme, Samui Dog pledged:</p>					
					<ul class="body">
						<li>• To inject all dogs and cats against rabies.</li>
						<li>• To sterilise all dogs and cats by castration or spaying.</li>
						<li>• To treat dogs suffering from mange by injecting them with Ivomec or by washing them with Amitraz.</li>
						<li>• To deworm all dogs and cats.</li>
						<li>• To treat all stray dogs and cats in the event of injury or sickness and give them somewhere to rest.</li>
						<li>• To educate the people of Koh Samui concerning the keeping of their animals.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>George and I spent 3 months volunteering at this shelter and have been made very aware of the hardships in running such an organisation.</p>
